//The process of finding the largest value is used frequently in computer applications.
// For example, a program that determines the winner of a sales contest would input
//the number of units sold by each salesperson. The salesperson who sells the most units wins the contest.
// Write a pseudocode program, then a Java application that inputs a series of 10 integers and determines
// and prints the largest integer. Your program should use at least the following three variables:
//a) counter: A counter to count to 10 (i.e., to keep track of how many numbers have been
//input and to determine when all 10 numbers have been processed).
//b) number: The integer most recently input by the user.
//c) largest: The largest number found so far.
